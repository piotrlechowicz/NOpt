###Newton algorithm for the unconstrained task

Newton gradient algorithm for finding the minimum of a function of two variables.
Newton method is the second order method, it means it uses not only the gradient but also the hesian to find the minimum.

Pre-requirements:
* numpy
* py_expression_eval
* pyplotlib
